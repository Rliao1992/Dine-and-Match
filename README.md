# Dine-and-Match
### The Concept:
“Dine and Match” is a website that allows users find the best wine match for their dinner.

### Techical: 
I created a PHP file that contains arrays representing all the possible results that will respond to all the combo requests that are sent from the client side with jQuery AJAX technolgy.
